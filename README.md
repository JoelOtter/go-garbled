A library for building and evaluating Yao's Garbled Circuits in Go.

Supports gates:
- AND
- OR
- NOT
- XOR
- NAND
- NOR
- XNOR

The aim is for ease of use and extensibility.

### Keys

Keys have the type uint32, but are in fact effectively 31-bit numbers. The most significant bit is a space left for the p-value which is to be encrypted along with the key. Keys are generated randomly, so it's not really necessary for a user to care about this detail.

The default encryption method is simply XOR between plaintext and key. Users can modify this themselves by adjusting the `Encryptor` field on the `Circuit` struct.
